This is a Windows simulator. So far it only support Windows 98, but please come back later to see if it has been updated to support more styles.

A lot of inspiration for styling the different components has been found around codepen primarily. I have later stumbled upon https://98.js.org/ which gave some more specific inspiration in the styling department, as well as https://winxp.vercel.app/

This is 100% a simulation. There is no emulation going on. Everything is custom coded from scratch using Typescript & ReactJS.
